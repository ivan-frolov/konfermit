# This is the test work for Konfermit

The main logic of test work is stored in directory src/core,
I see on this test work as an ability to test something new,
this why I chose react as interface to show the work of main module.
I have never used before react, this why, it could be painful to look
at this part of work. But, in my opinion, it's not so important,
because of the main part will be written as standalone module in vanilla js
(no any modules included, all is done myself).
